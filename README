Updates
------------

01/03/2013
+ Added test cases for the Xml Loader and Loader Callback classes
+ Added a JSON loader + test case
+ Added all test cases to a test suite
+ Moved to PHP5.4 array syntax. A PHP5.3 compatible version is now available in the PHP5.3 branch.
+ Fixed an issue where using named instances would trigger the autoloader with an invalid class name every time a class was created 


28/02/2014
+ Added basic namespace support. Documentation update will follow shortly. Also moved the XML loader into its own file, you'll need to include it separately if you're using it.
+ Please note: CHANGES ARE NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE. However they are easily fixed by doing the following find/replaces:

	new Dice => new \Dice\Dice
	new DiceInstance => new \Dice\Instance
	new DiceRule => new \Dice\Rule
